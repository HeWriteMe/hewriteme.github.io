ti: Democrats Wanted Trump

desc: He answered an inner longing.

The Blue Team secretly wanted Donald Trump all along.

That's why they ran such weak candidates (Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden,
Kamala Harris).

Trump is the one problem Democrats can "solve" -- even if they
literally do nothing, Trump will be gone within four years.

In the meantime, he deflects attention from America's real problems --
climate disaster, income inequality, unjust wars, rampant povery,
civilizational decline -- and the Democrats utter lack of either
solutions or seriousness.

Of course, they will never admit this.

Especially not to themselves.
